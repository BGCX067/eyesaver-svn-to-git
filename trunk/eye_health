Eye health with respect to computer use - 

The most common problem relating computer use and eyes is "computer eye syndrome" due to focussing the eyes on a computer display for protracted uninterrupted periods of time, and manifests as headache, dry eyes, blurred vision, neck pain, irritated eyes double vision and difficulty in refocussing the eyes.


	1. 20-20-20 rule - Eyes are invariably strained due to prolonged computer use. Ophthalmologists suggest the 20-20-20 rule to prevent the "computer eye syndrome". Look away from your computer at least every 20 minutes at a distant object (atleast 20 feet away) for at least 20 seconds.

	2. Blink frequently - moistens your eyes and prevents dryness and irritation which is likely to occur with uninterrupted computer use.

	3. Place the monitor properly - monitor top at the eye level and at a distance of 18-25 inches.

	4. Check lighting and reduce glare. Adjust the resolution of your screen to suit your sight. 

	5. Get enough rest, stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet. Wash eyes thouroughly twice a day.


Do take care of your eyes and reduce computer-use hours whenever possible, before any symptoms arise and necessitate the same!

When to see a doctor:-

See your doctor if you have ongoing symptoms that include:

	1. Eye discomfort
	2. A noticeable change in vision
	3. Double vision
	4. Headache

Computer use and body posture - 

	1. Situate your monitor directly in front of you, at eye level or just below. If you are looking 25 degrees below eye level, this disturbs the natural S-shape of your spine.

        2. Make sure your forearms also rest on the table, and not- only wrist and fingers on the table.

        3. Rest your feet on the floor. Dangling feet can cause back pain and poor circulation. 

        4. Put your chair closer, to avoid bending and reaching to the computer. This prevents excessive loading of the lower backand maintains the natural curve of the spine.

        5. Stretch your neck to the right, left, back and front during work. Stand frequently (every hour say) to 're-set' the spinal tension that has built up over the last hour of sitting.
